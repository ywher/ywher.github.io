I obtained the bachelor's degree in Automation from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020. Now I am a Ph.D. student in Control Science and Engineering Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by Professor Ming Yang.

My research interest includes scene segmentation, domain adaptation and their application in intelligent transporation system.
